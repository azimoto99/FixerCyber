# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The isometric renderer is currently corrupted with duplicate code, syntax errors, and incomplete implementation. This feature will completely rebuild the IsometricRenderer class to provide a robust, performant rendering system for the cyberpunk roguelike game. The renderer needs to handle isometric projection, depth sorting, performance optimization, and integration with existing game systems.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want a clean and functional isometric renderer, so that the game can properly display the cyberpunk world in isometric view.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the IsometricRenderer is instantiated THEN the system SHALL create a valid renderer without syntax errors
2. WHEN rendering sprites THEN the system SHALL properly convert world coordinates to isometric screen coordinates
3. WHEN rendering sprites THEN the system SHALL properly convert screen coordinates back to world coordinates
4. WHEN multiple sprites are rendered THEN the system SHALL sort them by depth for proper visual layering

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the renderer to handle different render layers, so that game objects appear in the correct visual order.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sprites are added with different render layers THEN the system SHALL render them in the correct layer order (GROUND, OBJECTS, CHARACTERS, EFFECTS, UI)
2. WHEN sprites have the same layer THEN the system SHALL sort them by depth value
3. WHEN sprites have the same layer and depth THEN the system SHALL sort them by zIndex
4. WHEN rendering the queue THEN the system SHALL process items from back to front for proper visual stacking

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the renderer to be performant, so that the game runs smoothly even with many sprites.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN rendering each frame THEN the system SHALL track and report performance statistics including FPS, frame time, and render time
2. WHEN sprites are outside the camera view THEN the system SHALL cull them from rendering to improve performance
3. WHEN the render queue is processed THEN the system SHALL efficiently sort items using optimized algorithms
4. WHEN performance stats are requested THEN the system SHALL provide accurate metrics for debugging and optimization

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the renderer to integrate with the camera system, so that the view can be controlled and moved around the world.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the camera position changes THEN the system SHALL update the rendering viewport accordingly
2. WHEN the camera zoom changes THEN the system SHALL scale the rendered sprites appropriately
3. WHEN converting coordinates THEN the system SHALL account for camera position and zoom level
4. WHEN rendering THEN the system SHALL use camera bounds for frustum culling

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the renderer to support lighting effects, so that the cyberpunk atmosphere can be enhanced with dynamic lighting.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a lighting system is provided THEN the system SHALL integrate with it during rendering
2. WHEN rendering sprites THEN the system SHALL apply lighting effects if available
3. WHEN lighting is disabled THEN the system SHALL render normally without lighting effects
4. WHEN lighting calculations are performed THEN the system SHALL maintain good performance

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a game developer, I want the renderer to handle sprite properties like transparency and height, so that visual effects can be properly displayed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN sprites have alpha values THEN the system SHALL render them with the specified transparency
2. WHEN sprites have height values THEN the system SHALL offset their vertical position for 3D effect
3. WHEN sprites have custom properties THEN the system SHALL preserve and use them during rendering
4. WHEN rendering transparent sprites THEN the system SHALL handle alpha blending correctly
