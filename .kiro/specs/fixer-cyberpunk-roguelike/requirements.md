# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Fixer is a hardcore multiplayer cyberpunk roguelike game featuring an isometric view of a procedurally generated dystopian city. Players spawn as mercenary "fixers" who receive contracts from AI fixers via cyber-augments, complete jobs for credits and gear, and can engage in PvP through assassination contracts. Players can purchase housing to save progress, or restart from scratch upon death. The game features neural programs that work like game cheats (wallhack.exe, aimbot.exe, bullettime.exe) and can overheat the player, creating a unique hacking-focused gameplay experience.
