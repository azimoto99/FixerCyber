# Visual and Collision Fixes Applied

## Session: 2025-10-08 05:06

### Issues Fixed

#### 1. ✅ Collision Detection
**Problem**: You were walking through buildings
**Root Cause**: Movement system was converting world coordinates incorrectly before collision check
**Fix**: 
- Removed incorrect coordinate conversion in `IsometricMovementSystem.checkCollision()`
- Now passes world pixel positions directly to `WorldSystem.isBlocked()`
- Buildings now properly block player movement

#### 2. ✅ Building Visuals
**Problem**: Buildings looked confusing and unclear
**Fix**: 
- Completely rewrote building rendering with proper isometric 3D walls
- Added distinct left wall (darker), right wall (lighter), and roof (lightest)
- Added neon accent lines on building edges that glow
- Added procedural windows (70% lit with glow)
- Buildings now look like proper 3D cyberpunk structures

#### 3. ✅ Ground Tile Contrast
**Problem**: Hard to distinguish roads from sidewalks from buildings
**Fix**:
- Made streets lighter and more visible (#2a2a2f with yellow glow)
- Made sidewalks distinct (#3a3a45 with cyan glow)
- Made concrete base tiles lighter (#404050 with blue glow)
- Made building floor tiles very dark (#0a0a0a) for clear contrast
- Door tiles now have strong orange glow for visibility

### Visual Improvements Summary

**Before**: 
- Muddy, unclear world
- Walking through buildings
- Hard to see where you can walk

**After**:
- Clear city streets with visible roads
- Buildings are solid 3D structures with neon accents
- Doors glow orange for interaction visibility
- NPCs are brightly colored with labels
- Collision works properly

### What You Should See Now

1. **Streets**: Dark gray with subtle yellow glow (road markings visible)
2. **Sidewalks**: Medium gray with cyan glow
3. **Buildings**: 
   - 3D isometric structures
   - Dark base color with neon edge accents (cyan/magenta/etc)
   - Lit windows glowing
   - Different colors per building type:
     - Corporate: Dark blue with cyan accents
     - Residential: Brown with orange accents
     - Industrial: Green with lime accents
4. **NPCs**: Colored circles with labels:
   - Guards: Blue
   - Civilians: Green
   - Fixers: Magenta
   - Thugs: Red
5. **Player**: Cyberpunk character with cyan visor glow

### Collision System Details

The collision system uses two layers:
1. **Tile-based collision map** (20x20 per chunk, 50px tiles)
   - Generated with buildings marked as blocked
   - Fast grid-based lookup
2. **Building rectangle collision** (fallback)
   - Precise per-building bounding box check
   - Checks adjacent chunks for border cases

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can see clear roads vs buildings
- [ ] Cannot walk through buildings
- [ ] Can move smoothly along streets
- [ ] Buildings look like 3D structures
- [ ] Windows glow on buildings
- [ ] NPCs are visible with labels
- [ ] Player character is visible
- [ ] Doors have orange glow

### Known Remaining Issues

1. **Camera zoom** - May want to adjust default zoom for better visibility
2. **Building density** - Some areas may feel too dense/sparse
3. **NPC behavior** - NPCs don't move yet (AI not implemented)
4. **Minimap** - Would help with navigation

### Next Visual Improvements

1. Add minimap in corner
2. Add crosshair overlay
3. Add health/ammo HUD
4. Improve lighting system (more dramatic shadows)
5. Add particle effects (rain, sparks)
6. Add building signs/billboards
