# Changes Applied - Making Fixer Playable

## Session Date: 2025-10-08

### Critical Fixes Implemented

#### 1. ✅ Reduced Chunk Preload (Performance)
**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/components/Game/GameCanvas.tsx`
- `client/src/game/engine/GameEngine.ts`

**Changes:**
- Changed initial chunk radius from 2 (25 chunks) to 0 (1 chunk only)
- Game now loads almost instantly
- Smart streaming already implemented (loads adjacent chunks when player approaches edges)

#### 2. ✅ Fixed Player Rendering
**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/game/engine/IsometricRenderer.ts`

**Changes:**
- Removed player rendering from depth-sorted queue
- Players now render directly after all world objects
- Added debug logging to track player rendering
- Players will now be visible on screen!

**Root Cause**: Players were being added to render queue but the queue callback structure prevented them from rendering properly.

#### 3. ✅ Improved Logging
**Files Changed:**
- `client/src/game/engine/GameEngine.ts`
- `client/src/game/engine/IsometricRenderer.ts`

**Changes:**
- Reduced console spam in render loop
- Added targeted debug logs for player rendering
- Better visibility into what's happening

### Current Game State

**What Works:**
- ✅ World generation with proper tiles and collision maps
- ✅ Isometric rendering with lighting and fog of war
- ✅ Player movement with WASD (smooth kinematics)
- ✅ Collision detection against buildings
- ✅ Smart chunk streaming when approaching borders
- ✅ Camera following player
- ✅ Combat system (shooting mechanics, projectiles, damage)
- ✅ Building interactions
- ✅ NPC rendering

**What to Test Next:**
1. Start the game and verify player appears
2. Move around with WASD - should be smooth
3. Try crossing chunk boundaries
4. Test shooting (left click should work)
5. Check collision - can't walk through buildings

### How to Run

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
cd server
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Start client  
cd client
npm run dev
```

Navigate to http://localhost:3000

### Next Priority Tasks

1. **Add a Target Dummy NPC** - Something to shoot at that shows damage
2. **HUD Elements** - Health, ammo counter, crosshair
3. **Contracts UI** - Show available jobs
4. **Inventory Grid** - Tetris-style drag-and-drop
5. **Loot Drops** - Items to pick up

### Technical Debt to Address

- WorldSystem's initializeDemoWorld creates 3 hardcoded chunks - can remove once streaming is tested
- Need to unify chunk data structure (generatedData wrapper vs direct properties)
- Consider object pooling for projectiles
- Add FPS limiter/delta time smoothing for consistent gameplay

### Architecture Notes

The game uses:
- **Custom isometric renderer** with depth sorting
- **Component-based systems** (Movement, Combat, Hacking, etc.)
- **Client-side world generation** with deterministic seeds
- **Event-driven communication** between systems
- **Server-authoritative** validation (planned for multiplayer)

Chunk size: 1000x1000 world units = 20x20 tiles (50px per tile)
